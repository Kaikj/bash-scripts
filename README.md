bash-scripts
============

## Introduction

A personal collection of useful bash scripts.

These scripts are written to automate any repetitive tasks that I may have as well as document the steps needed to set up any common dev environments that I may use. They are customized to my personal settings and the only reason they are on github is for portability.

## Usage

If `git` is not installed yet, download the zipfile from the sidebar.

If it is, just run:
  git clone git@github.com:Kaikj/bash-scripts.git

## Disclaimer
These scripts are not bug free and are fragile as I do not have the time now to test it out properly. Please use with caution.
